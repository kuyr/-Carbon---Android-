#### **Carbon Android App Automation Implementation**

I made use of the Page Object Model that has different directories; the Locators, Pages, Tests and Screenshots
with the unittest python testing framework\
`Before running: run on the terminal:` pip install Appium-Python-Client\
You could also use: source venv/bin/activate to navigate into the virtual environment\
To run the test simply run the: **_project/Tests/mainTest.py_** file in the Tests folder 
with **_python -m unittest mainTest.py_** it runs and saves a screen-shot of the third test
in the screenshot folder.

I really liked this task mainly cause of the actual implementation and the AUT was really good.
